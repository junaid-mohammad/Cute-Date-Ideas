## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this project was to practice **backend development** using **Node.js** and **Express**, while creating a fun and interactive web app. By building this project, I aimed to:

- Work with **Node.js** and **Express** for backend routing and request handling.
- Implement **EJS templating** to dynamically render pages with personalized content.
- Practice integrating **HTML/CSS** for a visually appealing front-end design.
- Explore **file structures and deployments** on **Microsoft Azure App Service**.

Additionally, this project was a creative way to build something personal and meaningful for my partner, providing ideas for cozy, outdoorsy, foodie, and wildcard dates!
