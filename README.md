## üéØ Purpose

The purpose of this project was to practice **backend development** using **Node.js** and **Express**, while creating a fun and interactive web app. By building this project, I aimed to:

- Work with **Node.js** and **Express** for backend routing and request handling.
- Implement **EJS templating** to dynamically render pages with personalized content.
- Practice integrating **HTML/CSS** for a visually appealing front-end design.
- Explore **file structures and deployments** on **Microsoft Azure App Service**.

Additionally, this project was a creative way to build something personal and meaningful for my partner, providing ideas for cozy, outdoorsy, foodie, and wildcard dates!

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Category-Based Suggestions**: Users can choose from four categories‚ÄîCozy, Outdoorsy, Foodie, and Wildcard‚Äîto get personalized date ideas.
- **Wildcard Option**: A unique feature where the app picks a random category first and then generates a random date idea from that category.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with a clean and modern look using **CSS** to ensure an engaging user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI works smoothly across devices, from desktops to smartphones.
- **Custom Styling**: Added a warm color palette and playful font to make the app visually appealing.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Express**: Framework for building web applications and APIs.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: Used for dynamic page rendering.
- **Body-Parser**: Middleware to handle form data submissions.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used to create and style the front-end pages.
- **Microsoft Azure App Service**: Used for deploying and hosting the web app.

## üß© What I Learned

- Practiced creating **dynamic routes** and **HTTP request handlers** with **Express**.
- Learned to work with **EJS templating** for building interactive and personalized web pages.
- Improved my ability to create **responsive front-end designs** using **HTML/CSS**.
- Explored **Microsoft Azure** for deploying full-stack applications.
- Gained experience in structuring a project with **public assets** for deployment readiness.

## üöÄ Deployment & Workflow

The **Cute Date Ideas** app is hosted on **Microsoft Azure App Service** and deployed using **Azure DevOps**, with code managed on **GitHub**.

### üõ† Deployment Setup

The **Cute Date Ideas** app is hosted on **Microsoft Azure App Service** with the code managed across **GitHub** and **Azure DevOps**.

### üõ† Deployment Setup (Steps We Took)

1. **Created Azure App Service**

   - Set up a new App Service instance through the Azure portal.

2. **Created GitHub Repo**

   - Initialized a new GitHub repository (`Cute-Date-Ideas`) and pushed all project files to it.

3. **Created Azure DevOps Project**

   - Created a project called _Cute Date Ideas_ in Azure DevOps.

4. **Added Azure DevOps as a Git Remote**

   - Used the following to connect local code to Azure DevOps:
     ```bash
     git remote add azure https://Junaid-Arif@dev.azure.com/Junaid-Arif/Cute%20Date%20Ideas/_git/Cute%20Date%20Ideas
     ```

5. **Push to Both Remotes**

   - Pushed the same codebase to both GitHub (`origin`) and Azure DevOps (`azure`):
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     git push azure main
     ```

6. **Configured Azure App Service to Pull from Azure DevOps Repo**

   - In the App Service Deployment Center, linked the Azure DevOps repo for Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

7. **Deployment Trigger Testing**

   - Confirmed that pushing to Azure DevOps automatically triggers a deployment to Azure App Service.

8. **Port Configuration**
   - No custom environment variables required since the app already supports:
     ```javascript
     const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
     ```

### üî• Deployment Workflow (Current)

Whenever you update code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main   # Pushes to GitHub
git push azure main    # Pushes to Azure DevOps and triggers deployment
```
